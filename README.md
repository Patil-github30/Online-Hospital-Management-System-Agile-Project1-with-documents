The Online Hotel Management System (OHMS) is a comprehensive software solution designed to automate and streamline the operations of a hotel. The system offers a robust platform for managing various hotel functions, including room reservations, check-in/check-out processes, guest services, staff management, and billing. OHMS aims to enhance the guest experience by providing a user-friendly interface for both customers and hotel staff, ensuring efficient handling of reservations, real-time room availability tracking, and quick response to customer needs.

Objective:
The primary objective of the OHMS project is to simplify and digitize the hotel management process, reducing manual workload, increasing efficiency, and improving overall service quality. The system is designed to accommodate different types of hotels, ranging from small inns to large chain hotels, and can be customized based on specific business requirements.
